# Fabmo Sb4 App

## About
This project is a work in progress establishing a FabMo App with the look and feel of the legacy Sb3 ShopBot Software -- familiar to ShopBot users.

## Getting Started
Starting the App will yield a CNC experinece and offer an interaction somewhat like the Windows-based ShopBot Software. The ShopBot CNC language, OpenSBP, is supported along with standard g-code. Interaction with the system is via a menuing system and command line input, virtually identical to the Sb3 ShopBot Software.

## Documentation
Currently the only available documentation is this README, along with the documentation provided in the code of the app itself.  A more comprehensive "guide" is coming soon. Documentation for the OpenSBP digital fab syntax is available at opensbp.org ...
